Set your Debt Freedom Date -- enter the amount owed on each debt and the date by which you want to be debt-free. The Debtlift calculator will tell you how much you need to pay each month to get there, and also give some ideas of how to git dat extra paper.
Debtlift was first written in Python3, currently being rebuilt in JavaScript.
